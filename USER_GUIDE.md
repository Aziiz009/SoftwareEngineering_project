 👤 User Guide – Attendance Management System

#1. Introduction

A teacher might start here to learn about handling student attendance through the Attendance Management System.

1. Start by opening a web browser
2. Go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/login

3. Enter:

Username: teacher
Password: teacher123

4. Click Login

After submitting, you’ll move straight to the attendance screen.


#3. Viewing Students

Once signed in, up comes a grid showing every student who has enrolled.
Fresh off the database, these learners show up.


#4. Marking Attendance

1. Click the “Speak Your Name” button
2. Say a student’s name
3. Once inside, the setup tracks who arrives or stays - no need to manually log it later

A student noted for the day cannot be added again - rules block repeats.


#5. Logging Out

A person can exit by clicking the Logout option.

This keeps the system safe from people who should not get in.


#6. System Behavior

Logged-in teachers alone handle marks on attendance
Whatever happens, attendance stays saved inside the database.
Even when the server resets, data sticks around.


#7. Conclusion

A fresh take on tracking who's present - this setup keeps things clean, runs quietly, leaves little room for error.
